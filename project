Cerebral layout - biologically specific use of space


join files (using bins)

intergrate d3 to html
query from json
2 types of nodes (reaction looks different)
javascript compute joining (consult stat)
search from node to node, search and show nodes hops away

task: tear incorrect joins, observe joined models (annotated 'from' model)

constraint by grouping compartment
edge thickness as stoichiometry
color
quantitative stat at filter (# of incoming and outgoing edges)
