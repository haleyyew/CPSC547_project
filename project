Cerebral layout - biologically specific use of space



intergrate d3 to html
2 types of nodes (reaction looks different)

//query from json
//	return multiple paths
join files (using bins)
	from output
	javascript compute joining (consult stat)
//search from node to node, search and show nodes hops away
//	traverse to a depth to find ancesters or descendents
//name to id mapping

task: tear incorrect joins, observe joined models (annotated 'from' model)

constraint by grouping compartment
edge thickness as stoichiometry
color, # of multiple ids
quantitative stat at filter (# of incoming and outgoing edges)
quantitative stat num of multiple ids

show this model and 2 adjacent models

Do make sure to indicate in your peer review 2 slides how far along you have gotten and what design decisions you have changed or solved. 
You need to think a lot more carefully about color coding
	it sounds like you're constructing what is known as a bipartite graph wwhere you have two distinct categories of nodes

 team projects will have 15 minutes to present with 1-2 minutes for questions
